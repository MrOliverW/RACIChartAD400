Creating and Analyzing a RACI Chart

The Oliver’s App project encompasses the development, deployment, and managing of Oliver’s App – A nifty smartphone app made for entertaining and wholesome conversation. The project aims to create the app, refine it and release it to the public over the course of about a year. Our goal is to have 1,000 users and overwhelmingly positive reviews and our vision is to help create good memories through the use of our app. We at Oliver’s app believe human connection is an incredibly valuable sum of wealth.


Using a RACI Chart in Google Docs

If I needed to add my RACI chart to project workspace such as Google Docs I would first open up a new document in Google Docs. Next I would click “Insert”; hover my mouse over “table” and then use the mouse to create a table which suits my needs. My RACI chart has 10 columns and 18 rows. The top column will be the header; the top leftmost column will list the tasks/subtasks and the next columns will list the name and title of the persons involved in the project. After this, I would carefully copy and paste the data from my RACI chart into the corresponding rows. If I was making a RACI chart from scratch I would fill out the datasheet by starting in the top left and working my way down the rows until I reach the next column; this way I’m able to focus on each person’s role as opposed to focusing on filling out my RACI chart based on task (this may be a matter of personal preference). Next, I would then format the header row, making it bold and increasing the font for visual appeal. It is also possible to link a google sheet to a google doc which would be my preference as there are more features in google sheets and it is possible to embed a table from Sheets into Docs and it will automatically be updated. To do this I would copy the data from Sheets and then in Docs I would go to “edit”, click “paste” and chose “Link to spreadsheet”. Alternatively, in Docs, you could click “insert” then “chart” then “from sheets” and select the data this way.

Project documents where linking/embedding this RACI chart will be beneficial

Project Charter
It would be very beneficial to have a RACI chart created prior for the project charter to avoid confusion regarding roles and responsibilities as the project transpires. 

Project Kick-off Meeting
Having a RACI chart ready at the project kick-off meeting will enable the team to get a better understanding of their duties. It will also enable the team to address any confusion or concerns regarding their duties. This can save a lot of resources in the future.
